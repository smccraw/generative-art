The Generative Art Playground is intended to be a place for those interested in playing around with using computers and algorithms to generate art. It all started with my own interest in exploring this space and as I encounter new and interesting techniques I will continue adding my discoveries here.

If you have any comments, feedback or especially any pointers to new and interesting techniques, please drop me a line at smccraw116@gmail.com.
